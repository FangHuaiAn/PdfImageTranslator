16 Strategy as a Profession for Future Generations Andrew 11V. Marshall A Visit to Chartres and Jouy One of Albert Wohlstelter's distincJive characte,i.slics has alway been his search for the absol-ule best <f whatever is available. This has been true of everything: people, technical advice, furniture, medical care, and, pe1·lwps most impor/ant~v, food.

In the mid-1950s, travel to Europe increased for many people at R/iND. In the faU of 19 56 my wife and 1 were in Paris at the same time as the Wohlsle/lers-Albl'rl, Roberta, mul Joani.f. Haruey DeWeerd was also there.. Early one Sunday mom.ing the six <f us wen/ eff to see 1hr: cathedral al Chames in a cnr Albert had rented. Albert had also noticed there was a one-star restauraril nearbJ, in the small I.own of Jouy. He telephon2d lo re.serve a. table.

II was unumally cold for November and, of course, the church was unheated. His enthusiasm and fulelage were unbounded while we muttered quietly and froze. Nol a tympamm1, portal, wi.ndow, or earning went wmoled, inside or out. Finally WI' dro,Je off lo Jouy-ravenous and shivering.

It was the first occasion for my wife and me to experience t.he wonderful French custom of a s-plendid SundaJ midday meal. Our expectations were high-muf. were reaiiud! A channing ruslfr inn, with gleaming coppn pans hanging in an open kitchen. The ebullient patron and his u)ije all smiles and welcomi-ng boo jours, a beaming presence in a room full of warmth and appetizing odors.

I canMt remember lhe entire m£al, but ils ma.in features were two mast pheasants with approp,-iate garnishment and an excellent raspberry souJJU. Both the cathedral mu:! th2 meal were memorable a1Ul excellent. m, owe that t.o Albert and his ejforl la make the most of every occasion. How does one become a strategic thinker?

16 將戰略作為未來世代的職業 安德魯 11V. 馬歇爾 參觀沙特爾和茹伊 阿爾伯特·沃爾斯泰特最獨特的性格特徵之一始終是他對任何可獲得之物的絕對最佳品質的追求。 這適用於一切：人、技術建議、家具、醫療保健，以及，或許最重要的是，食物。

在 1950 年代中期，前往歐洲旅行的人數在蘭德公司 (R/iND) 增加了。 1956 年秋天，我和我的妻子與沃爾斯泰特一家——阿爾伯特、羅伯塔和喬安妮——同時在巴黎。 哈維·德威爾德也在那裡。 一個星期天早上，我們六個人開著阿爾伯特租來的車去參觀沙特爾大教堂。 阿爾伯特還注意到在附近茹伊小鎮有一家一星級餐廳。 他打電話預訂了一張桌子。

十一月的天氣異常寒冷，當然，教堂也沒有暖氣。 當我們小聲抱怨並凍僵時，他的熱情和指導是無限的。 無論是內部還是外部，沒有一個山形牆、門戶、窗戶或裝飾被忽略。 最後，我們又餓又冷地開車前往茹伊。

這是我和我的妻子第一次體驗到法國美妙的星期天午餐習俗。 我們的期望很高——而且實現了！ 一家迷人的鄉村旅館，閃閃發光的銅鍋掛在開放式廚房中。 熱情洋溢的老闆和他的妻子笑容滿面，用熱情的法語問候，在一個充滿溫暖和誘人氣味的房間裡散發著光芒。

我不記得整頓飯的細節了，但它的主要特色是兩隻肥美的野雞，配以適當的裝飾和一份美味的覆盆子舒芙蕾。 大教堂和這頓飯都令人難忘且非常棒。 我們將這歸功於阿爾伯特和他盡力充分利用每一次機會的努力。 如何成為一個戰略思想家？ 什麼樣的訓練 302

SlraUp;j a.s a Profession JOJ or apprentic hip is eful? What i a trategin? These are all difficult questions.

Strat gy al o focuses on longer-term goals and reflects a cast of mind that focuses on sh:aping the future rather than simply reacting to it. Our vocabul_ary and us of words in these areas are seldom precise or accurate. 1 he word straugy tends to be used in many way . Jo particular I woulcll note that in the national security area, which is the main focus of thi piece, there is a con tant tendency to think of military strategy as related principally to the application of resources in a possible future war and the general guidance for more detailed planning for pecific contingencies. The result is that there is relatively little discussion of strategies for the peacetime management of our militaTy organizations and for the allocation of resources over time so a to develop more efficient, effective, competitive military forces with appropriate doctrines and concepts of operations. Given the existence of nuclear weapons, the highest priority objective for the Unit d States has been deterrence of large-scale war. In this we have been largely successful. Therefore, the strategic management prob! min our natjonal security establishment has been the peacetime competition to preserve and indeed enhance io the future our ability to deter the Soviet Union from actions adverse to our intere ts. ow ven this definition of our priority objective may need serious amendment .u we move into a more truly multipolar world.

It is clear that some people eem more readily able to address issues of trategy or the strategic management of oor national security efforts.

SlraUp;j 作為一種職業 JOJ 或是學徒制有用嗎？什麼是戰略家？這些都是難以回答的問題。首先，存在定義戰略思維或戰略本身的問題。這些定義上的問題似乎很難解決，而且在某種程度上，可能只是識別戰略思維的問題，當你看到它時就能辨認出來。但是，總體而言，戰略與戰術不同，它涉及組織高層活動的協調。戰略也側重於長期目標，並反映了一種著眼於塑造未來，而不僅僅是對未來做出反應的心態。我們在這些領域的詞彙和用詞很少精確或準確。 「戰略」這個詞往往以多種方式使用。特別是，我想指出，在國家安全領域（這是本文的重點），人們總是傾向於將軍事戰略視為主要與在未來可能發生的戰爭中應用資源以及為特定突發事件進行更詳細規劃的一般指導有關。結果是，對於我們軍事組織的和平時期管理以及隨著時間的推移分配資源以發展更有效率、更有效、更具競爭力的軍隊（具有適當的理論和作戰概念）的戰略，討論相對較少。鑑於核武器的存在，美國的最高優先目標一直是阻止大規模戰爭。在這方面，我們在很大程度上是成功的。因此，我們國家安全機構中的戰略管理問題一直是和平時期的競爭，以保持並在未來增強我們阻止蘇聯採取不利於我們利益的行動的能力。然而，隨著我們進入一個更加真正的多極世界，我們對優先目標的這種定義可能需要認真修改。

顯然，有些人似乎更容易解決戰略問題或國家安全努力的戰略管理問題。他們比其他人更願意並且更有自信地解決更大、更基本的問題。他們通常似乎為關於我們的戰略應該是什麼的討論帶來非常不同的觀點。他們是如何做到這一點的？什麼樣的訓練是有用的？這就是我接下來要討論的兩個部分。什麼樣的環境產生戰略家？

這是一個值得廣泛研究的問題。我所能做的就是利用我在 1950 年代和 1960 年代初期在蘭德公司 (RAND Corporation) 的經驗和觀察，以及我後來在 1972 年至今的政府部門的經驗。將蘭德公司作為戰略家生產者的關注點的一個缺點是，它顯然將討論偏向於對發展的分析。

304 Andrew W. Marshall of p ople who e role has been advisers in the sense that Herb Goldhamer treated in hi book, The .'\dt•iur. 1 There are other routes to being a strategist, including those who rea h high position in the military services or enter government ervic from other career lines uch as the law or investment banking. But the cas of RA D is p rhaps of sp cial int rest because it did provide in th ,1950s and early 1960 a11 environment thait produced a number of people who are now a knowledged a.<. major SLracegic thinkers. The RAND E"perience There wa something special about the R 1D nvironmem from the late 1940s through most of the 1960s. for one thing, especially in the late 1940 and the 1950s, there was a sen of being on the leading edg , of dealing with the centrally important problems. The invention of nuclear weapons and se,•eral oth r technology developmencs at the end of World War II producecl a , ituation that was quite n w, one in which the issue of what our trateg should be was extremely important.

Another aspect of this situation, given the large in rease in destructiv pawer nuclear weapons introduced, was that there were no experts. Two mall weapons had been used at the very end of World War II; what larger numbers of w apons migh do to change the nature of war was unclear. Nobel prize winners wer no better than graduate tudent in thinking about the relevant issues, and at meetings and working groups at RAND in the arly days there was no hierarchy. This was an ideal situation for younger people (the average age of the professional staff at RA O in 19!>0 was about twent -eight), who were immediat ly treated as equals and valued for what they could ontribute to the discussion . This is a rare situation, cenainly not characteristic of a ademia or normal organizations, and it led to the rapid development of individuals who wer willing to address the broadest issues of national security. There wa also a sense of having a preferred position with respect to access to infonnadon on the new de elopmenls taking place in weaponry, in particular in the design of nuclear weapons, their delivery systems, and other relevant technology. .

Two _other (hings favor d the d velopment of strategic thinking and innovation at RA D. On was the freedom RAND had LO select the problems and the issue· on which it worked. This is very cliff; rent from the environment in contract tudies organizations, e pecially now. The other wa the pre nee of everal remarkable men who set the !ntellectual tone and style of mu h of the broader analysis that began in. t~e arly 1950s. Two l would name are Charles Hitch and John Wilham , the heads respe tively of the Economics and the Mathematics

304 安德魯·W·馬歇爾（Andrew W. Marshall）等人，他們的角色是顧問，正如赫伯·戈德哈默（Herb Goldhamer）在他的書中所述的那樣。還有其他成為戰略家的途徑，包括那些在軍事部門中達到高位，或從法律或投資銀行等其他職業路線進入政府部門的人。但蘭德公司（RAND）的案例可能特別有趣，因為它在1950年代和1960年代初提供了一種環境，培養出了一批現在被認為是主要戰略思想家的人。蘭德公司的經驗：從1940年代末到1960年代的大部分時間裡，蘭德公司的環境有一些特別之處。首先，特別是在1940年代末和1950年代，人們有一種處於領先地位的感覺，即正在處理最重要的问题。第二次世界大戰末期核武器的發明和其他幾項技術發展，產生了一種全新的局面，在這種局面下，我們的戰略應該是什麼的問題變得極其重要。

這種情況的另一個方面是，鑑於核武器所帶來的巨大破壞力，當時沒有專家。在第二次世界大戰末期使用了兩枚小型武器；更大數量的武器可能如何改變戰爭的本質尚不清楚。諾貝爾獎得主在思考相關問題方面並不比研究生更好，而且在蘭德公司早期的會議和工作組中，沒有等級制度。對於年輕人來說，這是一個理想的環境（1950年蘭德公司專業人員的平均年齡約為二十八歲），他們立即被視為平等，並因他們能為討論做出的貢獻而受到重視。這是一種罕見的情況，肯定不是學術界或正常組織的特徵，它導致了那些願意解決最廣泛的國家安全問題的個人的迅速發展。人們還有一種感覺，即在獲取有關武器新發展的信息方面，特別是在核武器的設計、其運載系統和其他相關技術方面，擁有優先地位。

另外兩件事有利於蘭德公司戰略思維和創新的發展。一是蘭德公司有自由選擇其工作的問題和議題。這與合同研究組織的環境非常不同，尤其是現在。另一個是幾位傑出人物的存在，他們奠定了1950年代初開始的更廣泛分析的知識基調和風格。我想提名的兩位是查爾斯·希奇（Charles Hitch）和約翰·威廉姆斯（John Williams），他們分別是經濟學和數學部門的負責人。

Strategy as a Profession 305 Division . Apart from their wn intellectual contribution the· • · · · · f fi -. s, 1r mtere t in the cult1vat1on o ull-rangmg discus ion their intelle t I r · . . . , c ua 1airness, and their interest _in the development of younger people and of new method of analys1 all favored innovation. One of the interesting things that happened at RA o wa~ the succes of the economists in assuming a leading role in the direction or a ~umb~r of important tudies an_d, more generally, in shaping the way m which RAND addr ed national !iecuriry issues. Initially the econo~is~s were brou~ht into what had been largely a technological organization to deal wtth what was called the military worth function. It had becom clear LO the technical p ople that they needed some assistanc in thinking about the oojectives that military weapon systems were to achie e. There wa also some interest in the conomics of defense, especially as it dealt with issue of mobiliz.:nion, and in the targeting of an opponent's industrial capacity and a ssing damage to indu.str ial socierie from strategic bombing.

The economi ts soon played a much larger and more central role in managing and directing a numb r of the successful tudie . Why was this? Herman Kahn and I used to discuss chis puzzle. We had a number of hypotheses. For one thing the economics or the situation, broadlf conceived, were important. Whal things cost, the le,,el of resource that nations are able to devote to defen5e over an extended period-th se all shape one's views as to che kinds of weapon systems that are desirable and feasible. But another advantage the economists had was that they knew from their own experience that experts could be wrong. Indeed, they a.Isa knew that much discu5sion of economic ~roblems is foolish and that many widely held views, even among resp ns1ble people, are faulty. The experience or engineers and physicists i d!fferent. In those field there are real ex.perts who are much more hkely to be i-ight than are others. Economists. therefor , were more intellectually comfortable in the situation hat existed with respect to nuclear warfare, in which there were no exp res.

One of the people in the economics department who was the fir5l to lead and manage a large RAND stud)' wa Al~ert WohlSletter. Beginning in the early 1950s, he examined a set of issues connected with the basing of long-range bombers.

策略作為一個專業 305 部門。除了他們自己的知識貢獻之外，他們對培養全面討論的興趣、他們的知識公平性，以及他們對年輕人的發展和新的分析方法的興趣，都有利於創新。在蘭德公司發生的有趣的事情之一是經濟學家在領導一些重要的研究方面取得了成功，更廣泛地說，他們在塑造蘭德公司解決國家安全問題的方式方面也取得了成功。最初，經濟學家被帶到一個主要以技術為主的組織中，以處理所謂的軍事價值函數。技術人員清楚地意識到，他們需要一些幫助來思考軍事武器系統要實現的目標。人們也對國防經濟學感興趣，特別是它涉及動員問題，以及針對對手的工業能力和評估戰略轟炸對工業社會造成的損害。

經濟學家很快在管理和指導一些成功的案例中扮演了更大和更核心的角色。為什麼會這樣？赫爾曼·卡恩和我過去常常討論這個謎題。我們有一些假設。首先，廣義上講，情況的經濟性很重要。事物的成本、各國能夠在一段時間內投入國防的資源水平——這些都影響了人們對理想和可行的武器系統種類的看法。但經濟學家的另一個優勢是，他們從自己的經驗中知道，專家可能會犯錯。事實上，他們也知道，許多關於經濟問題的討論是愚蠢的，許多廣泛持有的觀點，即使是在負責任的人中，也是錯誤的。工程師和物理學家的經驗是不同的。在這些領域，有真正的專家，他們比其他人更有可能正確。因此，經濟學家在核戰爭方面的情況下，在沒有專家的情況下，在智力上更為自在。

經濟學系中第一個領導和管理大型蘭德研究的人是艾伯特·沃爾斯泰特。從 1950 年代初開始，他研究了一系列與遠程轟炸機基地有關的問題。該研究的結果已在本書的其他地方討論。我想指出在我看來，艾伯特在研究的進行中所做的主要創新或發明之一。在之前的大型蘭德研究中，實踐是在研究的一開始就提出一些替代系統或方案。該研究的重點是評估哪種替代系統最具成本效益。

;06 Andrew lV. Marshall Alb rt's approach was different. He started with a few alternative to the existing plan or program, but as the study went on he evolved improved alternatives. He was also le~s ri_gjd than .had been the practice in sening down the criteria, the objective functions, the measures of effectivenes at the beginning of the stud and imply s icking with them. Hise olutionar appr ach developed additional criteria and tests of performance as more understanding of the pr blems and the issues emerged. This was, in my judgment, a crucial invention for doing these kinds of studies, becau e one would learn much more abou the nature of the issues and the problems. how one ought lo look at them, and what criteria were rel vant as one went further along in the studies. Also, this way of conducting the analysis had the advantage of inventing additional and better alternatives to examin as one went along.

Another aspect of Lhe ituation al RA D that was exceptio11ally favorable to strategic thinking and inn vati n during the early period wa:; the practice of inviting first-rate people to come and spend the summer. This created an environment in which the important thing was to try to tap into the very best talent in the whole country. The objective was not to do the best that RA D could do with it.s exi sting staff, but in a sen to do an analysis that was the best that the cotmtry as a 1-.•hole could accomplish. By its very natur , any organization is limited in the amount and variety of talent, backgrounds, and insights that it can include among its staff. This attitude of searching for the very best people and drawing on the best talent is a key to excellence in broad thinking about any problem or issue. Unfortunately, most organization do not operate thi way.

There is perhaps a natural history to most organizations. When they are first formed they are fo used on a. mission, they recruit people who are enthusiastic and who devote themselves to the goals of th organization. As time goes on the organization becomes less flexible, accumulates some deadwood, and has some difficulty in sustaining the original vitality. Organizations ometimes are formed in especially suitable environments that allow them to Houri h for a time. hen the external environment changes and the organization declin s in vitality. In any case, the RAND of the 1950s and early l960s as a remarkable place, both for the talent it recruited and for its atmospher and intellectual dynamic. It wa also remarkabl for its boldn in addressing broader que tion of strategy. It is, th refore, not surprising that some interesting and influential people dev loped there.

The U.S. Government . The next experience tbat is perhaps relevant comes from my time in government. Beginning in the middle 1970 , I was involved in

;06 安德魯·馬歇爾（Andrew lV. Marshall Alb rt）的方法不同。他從現有計畫或方案的幾個替代方案開始，但隨著研究的進行，他不斷發展出改進的替代方案。他也不像過去那樣嚴格地設定標準、目標函數以及在研究開始時衡量有效性的指標，然後就一成不變地堅持下去。他的演進式方法隨著對問題和議題的理解加深，發展出額外的標準和績效測試。在我看來，這是進行這類研究的一項關鍵發明，因為人們可以更深入地了解問題和議題的本質，了解應該如何看待它們，以及隨著研究的深入，哪些標準是相關的。此外，這種進行分析的方式還具有發明額外和更好的替代方案以供檢驗的優勢。

蘭德公司（RA D）在早期階段，另一項特別有利於戰略思考和創新的方面是：邀請一流人才來度過夏天。這創造了一種環境，在這種環境中，最重要的是努力挖掘全國最優秀的人才。目標不是讓蘭德公司用現有員工做到最好，而是在某種意義上，進行一項全國整體能夠完成的最佳分析。就其本質而言，任何組織在人才、背景和見解的數量和多樣性方面都受到限制，這些人才、背景和見解可以納入其員工隊伍中。這種尋找最優秀的人才並利用最優秀的人才的態度，是廣泛思考任何問題或議題時取得卓越成就的關鍵。不幸的是，大多數組織並非以這種方式運作。

大多數組織可能都有一個自然歷史。當它們最初成立時，它們專注於一個使命，它們招募熱情並致力於組織目標的人。隨著時間的推移，組織變得不那麼靈活，積累了一些冗員，並且難以維持原有的活力。有時，組織是在特別合適的環境中形成的，這使得它們能夠繁榮一段時間。然後，外部環境發生變化，組織的活力下降。無論如何，20世紀50年代和60年代初的蘭德公司是一個非凡的地方，無論是它招募的人才，還是它的氛圍和智力活力。它在解決更廣泛的戰略問題方面的膽識也令人矚目。因此，在那裡發展出一些有趣且有影響力的人並不令人驚訝。

People who were systems analyst.s found it difficu.lt to address the sorts of questions chat we felt needed t.o be considered in strategic planning. People with a business background or a com-bination of bus!ness school and mi!itary service seemed to be among the best at taking up and addressing the questions we wanted dealt with. We saw it as a vaccination problem: some backgrounds promoted strategic thinking and others seemed to innoculate people against it. Why is that?

To some extent, the systems analysts had by that time developed routine approaches to analysis and perhaps had ceased paying sufficient attention to the complex consequences of acquiring the systems they dealt with. James Schlesinger made a comment to me a number of years ago that systems analysis proceeds by trivializing the mea-surement of effectiveness while perfecting the analysis and the estimate of costs.

Programmatic actions, the acquisition of particular weapon systems, the adoption of a new concept of operations, or the setting of new objectives for military forces have complex consequences, including their effects upon the beliefs, actions, and resource allocation patterns of the potential opponents. Most of these consequences are not usually considered in the standard kinds. of analysis. One result is that the top leadership of the Department of Defense ofte~ gets remarkably little assistance from their staffs when truly strategic de-cisions are addressed.

This is because the focus of the work of the staffs, the criteria they use, and their measures of effectiveness_ ~re too narrow to account for the considerations that top-level dec1s1on makers in fact want to consider, are concerned with, and take imo account as best they can. Some decisions have larger and different consequences than others. For example, a decision to pursue or create a major strategic _defense capability is different from a decision among several alternat~,•e pro-grams for the next generation of fighter aircraft.

策略作為一種專業）07 試圖在國防部啟動戰略規劃活動，並在某種程度上指導戰略規劃實驗。特別是，當時的海軍指揮官詹姆斯·羅奇（James Roche）在1975-1976年間撰寫了幾篇論文，以促進國防部的戰略思維。我們還贊助了承包商研究，研究戰略規劃的某些方面。這種經驗使我相信，雖然系統分析在其早期發展中是一種解放力量，但到1970年代中期，它已成為戰略思維的制約。

身為系統分析師的人發現很難解決我們認為需要在戰略規劃中考慮的各類問題。具有商業背景或商學院和軍事服務相結合的人似乎最擅長接受和解決我們希望處理的問題。我們將其視為一種疫苗接種問題：某些背景促進了戰略思維，而另一些背景似乎使人們對其產生免疫力。為什麼會這樣？

在某種程度上，系統分析師到那時已經開發了例行分析方法，並且可能已經停止充分關注獲取他們所處理的系統的複雜後果。詹姆斯·施萊辛格（James Schlesinger）多年前對我說過，系統分析的過程是通過簡化有效性的衡量標準，同時完善分析和成本估算來進行的。

計劃性行動、特定武器系統的採購、新作戰概念的採用或軍隊新目標的設定都會產生複雜的後果，包括它們對潛在對手的信念、行動和資源分配模式的影響。在標準類型的分析中，通常不考慮這些後果中的大多數。結果之一是，當解決真正的戰略決策時，國防部的高層領導往往從其工作人員那裡獲得的幫助非常少。

這是因為工作人員的工作重點、他們使用的標準以及他們的有效性衡量標準過於狹窄，無法考慮高層決策者實際上想要考慮、關心並盡可能考慮的因素。有些決策比其他決策具有更大和不同的後果。例如，追求或創建主要戰略防禦能力的決定不同於在下一代戰鬥機的幾個替代方案之間做出的決定。

前者涉及美國軍方進入一項新業務（儘管這是一項我們曾經從事的現有業務的延續），後者是延續。涉及不同的問題，似乎需要不同形式的分析，但現有的分析方法往往將這兩種類型的決策視為相同。

For many people, some period of intense in ·olvement in an imponant, large-scale project or merprise has proved to be crucial.

Marslial/ 以相同的方式。部分問題可能在於，現有的分析方法大多（如果不是全部）是為了協助採購或營運規劃決策而開發的。當問題更像是：我應該從事什麼業務？我的競爭優勢在哪裡？時，就需要其他的分析方法。來自商業界或商學院的人可能擁有的優勢是，他們習慣於處理這些問題，儘管他們使用的分析方法可能不那麼系統化。什麼樣的背景和經驗有助於戰略思考？沒有一套特定的學科是必須掌握才能成為戰略家的。具有戰略思維的人來自不同的背景。在我遇到並覺得我個人認識的人中，最好的學術背景似乎是經濟學、商學院、應用技術（特別是對於那些在商業界的人），以及在某些情況下是政治學。但似乎最重要的是一種心態，即具有質疑精神、兼收並蓄、能夠提出最廣泛的問題和目標，並且能夠制定實現這些目標的適當方法。對於必然伴隨任何向前思考十年、二十年努力的不確定性，需要高度的容忍度。對於許多人來說，一段時間內深入參與一個重要的、大型的項目或企業已被證明至關重要。第二次世界大戰對許多人來說就是這樣一種經歷，而且，確實可能存在一種世代因素在起作用：生活在有趣的時代可能有助於成為一名優秀的戰略家。那些參與——即使只是在幕僚職位或邊緣——與那場戰爭相關的某個主要決策機構的人，都具有一種特殊的品質。第二次世界大戰的經驗顯然對 1950 年代在蘭德公司工作的許多人產生了重大影響。因為他們包含許多具有二戰經驗的人，杜魯門和艾森豪威爾政府具有一種有利於戰略思考的特徵。自 1950 年代末以來，行政部門的這種特徵已逐漸消失。我們現在看到的美國安全環境的變化將迫使我們再次努力重新思考我們的處境、我們的目標和我們的戰略。因此，這可能是一個時代，由於他們在未來十年將經歷的關鍵經驗，將會湧現出一代戰略思想家。回到什麼樣的學術研究或專業培訓可能有用這個問題，我會從經濟學和商業開始。

Strattgy as o Profession 309 school training, pecially busine s school that have st . . rong programs in business policy and strategy. My recommendation abo . . ut economics is, however, a guarded on . Since the 1940s and 1950 • . . s, economics training has become too mathematical too focus d on the . · · · . . · • acqu1m1on of par11cular a_nalyttc tools that are not, in fact, or mu h use in the national security area. S mething like the fir t course in graduate school ma be enough. They are important, how ver, because people who do not have a sense of macroeconomics and the fundamemal trad -offs that soci ti_es h_ave _ to make find it difficult to think clearly about the long-term 1mpl_1cauons of devoting large, possibly exce sive, percentages of gros nauonal pr ducts (G Ps) to mihtar use . The current stat of the Soviet nion i in some part the result of decades of a heavy military burden with perhaps on the order of 25 to 50 percent of G P devoted to the military and the external empire.

In the early 19 0 , when the first initiatives were taken within the Defen e Department to encourage appli ation of a set of ideas that later w re labeled a competitive strategi , I had a discussion with the chief of one of the military services. His reaction to the idea of designing some military programs so as to impose increased costs upon the Soviets was negative, or at least cautious. He had two arguments against focu ing on increasing Soviet costs or expenditures. The first was that the (')viets would simply pend the extra money, there were no reasons for them not to do so; the second was that our own budg ts fluctuate so much that it was unwi e to stimulate a competition which we ourselves might not sustain. The econd of these arguments has real m rit to it. The firs! shows an unawareness of the long-term consequences for the Soviet of high levels of militaq' expenditures or of possible trade-offs between individual program the Sovieu; might be compelled to make, since resources always are limited, .

Another virtue of economics training, or for that matter busm s-school training, is that a modest amount of mathematics is ac~~ired, as is some sense of the importance of te hnology and _an ~bihty t? interact more effectively with technologist and hard s~1~m1st~.

策略作為一種專業，需要309所學校的訓練，特別是那些在商業政策和策略方面擁有強大課程的商學院。然而，我對經濟學的建議是謹慎的。自1940年代和1950年代以來，經濟學訓練變得過於數學化，過於注重於特定分析工具的獲取，而這些工具實際上在國家安全領域的用處不大。研究生院的第一門課程可能就足夠了。然而，它們很重要，因為那些對總體經濟學和社會必須做出的基本權衡沒有概念的人，很難清楚地思考將大量，甚至可能過多的國民生產總值（GNP）用於軍事用途的長期影響。蘇聯目前的狀況，在某種程度上是數十年來沉重軍事負擔的結果，可能將大約25%到50%的GNP用於軍事和外部帝國。

在190年代初期，當國防部內部首次採取行動，鼓勵應用一套後來被稱為競爭策略的理念時，我與其中一個軍種的首長進行了討論。他對設計一些軍事計劃以增加蘇聯成本的想法持否定態度，或至少是謹慎的。他提出了兩個反對將重點放在增加蘇聯成本或支出的論點。首先是蘇聯會簡單地花掉額外的錢，沒有理由不這樣做；第二是我們自己的預算波動太大，刺激一場我們自己可能無法維持的競爭是不明智的。第二個論點確實有其道理。第一個論點表明，他沒有意識到蘇聯長期軍事支出過高或蘇聯可能被迫在各個項目之間進行權衡的長期後果，因為資源總是有限的。

經濟學訓練，或者就此而言，商學院訓練的另一個優點是，可以獲得適量的數學知識，以及對技術重要性的一些認識，以及與技術專家和硬科學家更有效地互動的能力。這是1950年代初期，經濟學家在蘭德公司（RAND）相對於政治學家的優勢之一：定量分析是經濟學家習慣的，他們對技術專家正在做的事情的興趣或討論和理解能力，比政治學家略勝一籌。

人口統計學是另一個應該比過去在戰略發展中受到更多關注的領域。人口統計學與政治和軍事行為的關係，很可能是一個日益重要和受到關注的領域。人口統計學是廣泛的國家政策，經常被帶入戰略討論中。

JJO Andrew W Marshall but in only the most obvious and limited ways. William McNeill r cently wrote a small volume adde ing some of the broader relationships of demography to political behavior.2 As in other of his works, he provides a number of hypotheses and ketche out areas that de erve considerably more attention. Additional fields of intere t are cultural anthropology, ethology, and some areas of psychology. In some ways a new und rstanding of man is emerging, based on tudy of the evolution of man and human society and on new analy es of the biology of man, in particular th fonctioning ofth brain.

How men proces information, make decisions, and behav are central issue on which much new knowledge exists and more will be available in the future. But above all, if I had a suggotion to make, il would be that peopl study, in any case at least read, hisrory of all kinds: military history, of course, but also economic and technological history. The history or analysis of past wars is a major antidote to the narrow focus of man existing m thod of analysis o( d fense issues.

Most discussion of strategy and defen e programs is, if anything, too focu ed on technology and weaponry and not enough on the other factors that ofren dominate actual •.-.-arfare. Also, if on considers the xtended competition between states such as Rome and Carthage, the issue of why the Romttn won in the end may shed interesting light on the key variables that need to be considered in our conceptions of strategy. Anoth r thing that i_§ of great importance is to understand the differences in the ways in which other nations are likely to perceive situations and react to them.

pecialized studi . of the strategic culture of the Soviet Union, China, India, Japan, and the European nations are of great us . Some of this can be gained by reading the history of these nations, especially the development of their military and other national se<:urit organizations. Other aspects relate co the particular cultural characteristics of these societies. The Future of trategy We are at a major turning point in the hi tory of the world.

A new structure is emerging, a more multipolar world with more complex alliance arrangements. Technology is likely to change the nature of warfare, much as it did in the period of the 1920s and 1930s. Then the development of naval aircraft and aircraft carriers revolutionized war at sea; on land the development of the tank and rugged, portable radios led to the invention of the panzer division and new concepts of operations that changed the nature of theater warfare; and, of course, there was the development of tactical and strate1Zic air forces.

JJO 安德魯·W·馬歇爾，但僅以最明顯和有限的方式。威廉·麥克尼爾最近寫了一本小冊子，探討了人口統計學與政治行為之間更廣泛的關係。正如他在其他著作中一樣，他提出了一些假設，並概述了一些值得更多關注的領域。其他感興趣的領域包括文化人類學、行為學和心理學的某些領域。在某些方面，一種對人類的新理解正在出現，基於對人類和人類社會進化的研究，以及對人類生物學的新分析，特別是大腦的功能。

人們如何處理信息、做出決策和行為是核心問題，在這方面已經存在許多新的知識，未來還會有更多。但最重要的是，如果我有一個建議，那就是人們應該研究，至少應該閱讀各種歷史：當然是軍事史，還有經濟史和技術史。過去戰爭的歷史或分析是對現有國防問題分析方法狹隘視野的主要解藥。

大多數關於戰略和國防計劃的討論，如果有的話，過於關注技術和武器，而沒有足夠關注其他經常主導實際戰爭的因素。此外，如果考慮到羅馬和迦太基等國家之間長期存在的競爭，羅馬人最終獲勝的原因可能會為我們在戰略概念中需要考慮的關鍵變量提供有趣的啟示。另一件非常重要的事情是了解其他國家可能感知情況並對其做出反應的方式的差異。

對蘇聯、中國、印度、日本和歐洲國家的戰略文化進行的專門研究非常有用。其中一些可以通過閱讀這些國家的歷史來獲得，特別是它們的軍事和其他國家安全組織的發展。其他方面與這些社會的特定文化特徵有關。戰略的未來 我們正處於世界歷史上的一個重要轉折點。

一種新的結構正在出現，一個更加多極化的世界，擁有更複雜的聯盟安排。技術很可能會改變戰爭的本質，就像它在 1920 年代和 1930 年代所做的那樣。當時，海軍飛機和航空母艦的發展徹底改變了海戰；在陸地上，坦克和堅固耐用的便攜式無線電的發展導致了裝甲師的發明和改變戰區戰爭本質的新作戰概念；當然，還有戰術和戰略空軍的發展。

What our strategy should be for the more complex competition that is emerging will require consideration of many aspects of the changing security environment and changing technology. We will need to know much more than we now do about the emerging regional powers, as well as about the likely major actors, their strategic orientation, their strengths, and their weaknesses. It is to be hoped that new centers of strategic thought and innovation will arise and a new generation of strategists and military innovators will develop to deal with these problems. Notes ).

策略作為一種進程 311 新武器需要發展新的準則、新的作戰概念，以及新的軍事組織，以充分利用新技術。在接下來的二十年中，我們如何維持美國的軍事和國家安全地位，是一個必須解決的核心問題。我們應對新興的更複雜競爭的策略應該是什麼，將需要考慮不斷變化的安全環境和不斷變化的技術的許多方面。我們需要比現在更多地了解新興的區域強權，以及可能的主要參與者、他們的戰略方向、他們的優勢和他們的劣勢。希望新的戰略思想和創新中心能夠出現，並且新一代的戰略家和軍事創新者能夠發展起來，以應對這些問題。 註釋 ).
