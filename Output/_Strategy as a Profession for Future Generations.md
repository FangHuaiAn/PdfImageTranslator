16 Strategy as a Profession for Future Generations Andrew 11V. Marshall A Visit to Chartres and Jouy One of Albert Wohlstelter's distinctive characteristics has always been his search for the absolute best of whatever is available. This has been true of everything: people, technical advice, furniture, medical care, and, perhaps most importantly, food. In the mid-1950s, travel to Europe increased for many people at RAND. In the fall of 1956 my wife and I were in Paris at the same time as the Wohlstetters—Albert, Roberta, and Joan. Harvey DeWeerd was also there. Early one Sunday morning the six of us went off to see the cathedral at Chartres in a car Albert had rented. Albert had also noticed there was a one-star restaurant nearby, in the small town of Jouy. He telephoned to reserve a table. It was unusually cold for November and, of course, the church was unheated. His enthusiasm and tutelage were unbounded while we muttered quietly and froze. Not a tympanum, portal, window, or carving went unnoted, inside or out. Finally we drove off to Jouy—ravenous and shivering. It was the first occasion for my wife and me to experience the wonderful French custom of a splendid Sunday midday meal. Our expectations were high—and were realized! A charming rustic inn, with gleaming copper pans hanging in an open kitchen. The ebullient patron and his wife all smiles and welcoming bonjours, a beaming presence in a room full of warmth and appetizing odors. I cannot remember the entire meal, but its main features were two roast pheasants with appropriate garnishment and an excellent raspberry soufflé. Both the cathedral and the meal were memorable and excellent. We owe that to Albert and his effort to make the most of every occasion. How does one become a strategic thinker? What sort of training 302

16 未來世代的專業策略 安德魯·馬歇爾 參觀沙特爾和茹伊 阿爾伯特·沃爾斯特特的一個顯著特徵一直是他尋求現有事物中最好的絕對標準。這適用於一切：人員、技術建議、家具、醫療保健，或許最重要的是食物。在1950年代中期，許多在RAND工作的人前往歐洲的次數增加。1956年秋天，我和妻子與沃爾斯特特一家——阿爾伯特、羅伯塔和瓊——同時在巴黎。哈維·德維爾德也在那裡。星期天一大早，我們六個人乘坐阿爾伯特租來的車前往參觀沙特爾大教堂。阿爾伯特還注意到附近的小鎮茹伊有一家一星級餐廳。他打電話預訂了一張桌子。十一月的天氣異常寒冷，當然，教堂是沒有供暖的。他的熱情和指導無邊無際，而我們則在一旁小聲抱怨並凍得發抖。無論是鼓室、門廊、窗戶還是雕刻，無一被忽略，無論是內部還是外部。最後，我們開車前往茹伊——又餓又冷。這是我和妻子第一次體驗法國美妙的星期天中午大餐。我們的期望很高——並且得到了滿足！一個迷人的鄉村小旅館，開放式廚房裡掛著閃閃發光的銅鍋。熱情的店主和他的妻子滿面笑容地迎接我們，房間裡充滿了溫暖和誘人的氣味。我不記得整頓飯的全部內容，但主要特色是兩隻烤野雞配上合適的裝飾和一個極好的覆盆子舒芙蕾。無論是大教堂還是這頓飯都令人難忘且出色。我們要感謝阿爾伯特和他努力讓每次機會都發揮到極致。如何成為一名戰略思考者？需要什麼樣的訓練？

304 Andrew W. Marshall of people whose role has been advisers in the sense that Herb Goldhamer treated in his book, The .'\dt•iur. 1 There are other routes to being a strategist, including those who reach high positions in the military services or enter government service from other career lines such as the law or investment banking. But the case of RAND is perhaps of special interest because it did provide in the 1950s and early 1960s an environment that produced a number of people who are now acknowledged as major strategic thinkers. The RAND Experience There was something special about the RAND environment from the late 1940s through most of the 1960s. For one thing, especially in the late 1940s and the 1950s, there was a sense of being on the leading edge, of dealing with the centrally important problems. The invention of nuclear weapons and several other technology developments at the end of World War II produced a situation that was quite new, one in which the issue of what our strategy should be was extremely important. Another aspect of this situation, given the large increase in destructive power nuclear weapons introduced, was that there were no experts. Two small weapons had been used at the very end of World War II; what larger numbers of weapons might do to change the nature of war was unclear. Nobel prize winners were no better than graduate students in thinking about the relevant issues, and at meetings and working groups at RAND in the early days there was no hierarchy. This was an ideal situation for younger people (the average age of the professional staff at RAND in 1950 was about twenty-eight), who were immediately treated as equals and valued for what they could contribute to the discussions. This is a rare situation, certainly not characteristic of academia or normal organizations, and it led to the rapid development of individuals who were willing to address the broadest issues of national security. There was also a sense of having a preferred position with respect to access to information on the new developments taking place in weaponry, in particular in the design of nuclear weapons, their delivery systems, and other relevant technology. Two other things favored the development of strategic thinking and innovation at RAND. One was the freedom RAND had to select the problems and the issues on which it worked. This is very different from the environment in contract studies organizations, especially now. The other was the presence of several remarkable men who set the intellectual tone and style of much of the broader analysis that began in the early 1950s. Two I would name are Charles Hitch and John Williams, the heads respectively of the Economics and the Mathematics.

304 安德魯·W·馬歇爾是那些在赫伯·戈德哈默的書《顧問》中被描述為顧問角色的人之一。成為戰略家的途徑還包括那些在軍事服務中達到高位或從其他職業路線如法律或投資銀行進入政府服務的人。但RAND的案例或許特別有趣，因為在1950年代和1960年代初期，它提供了一個環境，培養出了一批現在被公認為主要戰略思想家的人。RAND的經驗 從1940年代末到1960年代大部分時間，RAND的環境有些特別。首先，尤其是在1940年代末和1950年代，有一種處於前沿的感覺，處理著至關重要的問題。核武器的發明和二戰結束時的幾項其他技術發展創造了一個全新的局面，其中我們的戰略應該是什麼的問題極其重要。這種情況的另一個方面是，由於核武器引入的巨大破壞力增加，沒有專家。二戰結束時使用了兩個小型武器；更多武器可能如何改變戰爭的性質尚不清楚。諾貝爾獎得主在思考相關問題上並不比研究生更好，而在RAND早期的會議和工作小組中沒有等級制度。這對年輕人來說是一個理想的情況（1950年RAND專業人員的平均年齡約為28歲），他們立即被視為平等，並因他們能為討論做出的貢獻而受到重視。這是一種罕見的情況，當然不是學術界或正常組織的特徵，這導致了願意解決國家安全最廣泛問題的個人的快速發展。還有一種感覺是，在獲取武器新發展的信息方面，特別是在核武器的設計、其運輸系統和其他相關技術方面，擁有優先地位。還有兩件事促進了RAND的戰略思維和創新發展。一是RAND有自由選擇其研究的問題和議題。這與合同研究機構的環境非常不同，尤其是現在。另一個是幾位傑出人物的存在，他們在1950年代初期開始的許多廣泛分析中設置了知識氛圍和風格。我會提到的兩位是查爾斯·希奇和約翰·威廉姆斯，分別是經濟學和數學的負責人。

Strategy as a Profession attempts to initiate strategic planning activities in the Department of Defense and in the direction of some strategic planning experiments. In particular, James Roche, then a navy commander, wrote several papers during 1975-1976 to promote strategic thinking in the Defense Department. We also sponsored contractor research on some aspects of strategic planning. This experience led me to believe that while systems analysis had been a liberating force during its early development, by the middle 1970s it had become a constraint on thinking strategically. People who were systems analysts found it difficult to address the sorts of questions that we felt needed to be considered in strategic planning. People with a business background or a combination of business school and military service seemed to be among the best at taking up and addressing the questions we wanted dealt with. We saw it as a vaccination problem: some backgrounds promoted strategic thinking and others seemed to inoculate people against it. Why is that? To some extent, the systems analysts had by that time developed routine approaches to analysis and perhaps had ceased paying sufficient attention to the complex consequences of acquiring the systems they dealt with.

James Schlesinger made a comment to me a number of years ago that systems analysis proceeds by trivializing the measurement of effectiveness while perfecting the analysis and the estimate of costs. Programmatic actions, the acquisition of particular weapon systems, the adoption of a new concept of operations, or the setting of new objectives for military forces have complex consequences, including their effects upon the beliefs, actions, and resource allocation patterns of the potential opponents. Most of these consequences are not usually considered in the standard kinds of analysis. One result is that the top leadership of the Department of Defense often gets remarkably little assistance from their staffs when truly strategic decisions are addressed. This is because the focus of the work of the staffs, the criteria they use, and their measures of effectiveness are too narrow to account for the considerations that top-level decision makers in fact want to consider, are concerned with, and take into account as best they can.

Some decisions have larger and different consequences than others. For example, a decision to pursue or create a major strategic defense capability is different from a decision among several alternative programs for the next generation of fighter aircraft. The former involves going into a new business for the U.S. military (although it is a business we once were in), the latter the continuation of an existing business. Different issues are involved, different forms of analysis seem needed, but existing analysis methods tend to treat the two types of decisions alike.

作為一種職業的戰略試圖在國防部啟動戰略規劃活動，並朝著一些戰略規劃實驗的方向發展。特別是，當時的海軍指揮官詹姆斯·羅奇在1975-1976年間撰寫了幾篇論文，以促進國防部的戰略思維。我們還贊助了關於戰略規劃某些方面的承包商研究。這段經歷讓我相信，雖然系統分析在其早期發展階段是一種解放力量，但到了1970年代中期，它已成為戰略思維的一種限制。系統分析師發現很難解決我們認為在戰略規劃中需要考慮的問題。具有商業背景或商學院和軍事服務相結合的人似乎是最能夠承擔和解決我們希望處理的問題的人。我們將其視為一種疫苗接種問題：某些背景促進了戰略思維，而其他背景似乎使人們對此免疫。為什麼會這樣？在某種程度上，系統分析師當時已經開發出常規的分析方法，並且可能不再充分關注他們所處理系統的複雜後果。

詹姆斯·施萊辛格多年前對我說過，系統分析通過簡化效能測量來進行，同時完善成本分析和估算。計劃行動、特定武器系統的獲取、新作戰概念的採用或為軍事力量設定新目標都具有複雜的後果，包括它們對潛在對手的信念、行動和資源分配模式的影響。大多數這些後果通常不在標準分析中考慮。結果之一是，當真正的戰略決策被提出時，國防部的高層領導往往從他們的工作人員那裡獲得的幫助非常少。這是因為工作人員的工作重點、他們使用的標準和效能測量過於狹隘，無法考慮高層決策者實際上想要考慮、關心並盡可能考慮的因素。

有些決策比其他決策具有更大和不同的後果。例如，追求或創建一個主要戰略防禦能力的決策與在下一代戰鬥機的幾個替代計劃中做出決策是不同的。前者涉及美國軍方進入一個新業務（儘管這是我們曾經從事的業務），後者則是現有業務的延續。涉及的問題不同，似乎需要不同的分析形式，但現有的分析方法往往將這兩種類型的決策視為相同。

308 Andrew W. Marslial/ the same way. Part of the problem may be that much if not all of the existing analysis methodology was developed to assist in procurement or operational-planning decisions. Other method of analysis are necessary when the questions are more like: What business should I be in? Where are my competitive advantages? One advantage people from the business world or business schools may have is that they are used to addressing these kinds of questions, though often with analysis methods that are less systematic. What Backgrounds and Experiences Are Conducive to Strategic Thinking? There is no specific set of disciplines that must be mastered to be a strategist. People who think strategically come from a number of different backgrounds. Among those whom I have met and feel that I know personally the best academic backgrounds seem to be economics, business school, applied technology (especially for those who have been in the business world), and in some cases political science. But what seems to be central is a cast of mind that is questioning, eclectic, able to devise the broadest kind of issues and goals, and able to formulate appropriate ways of achieving these goals. A high tolerance for the uncertainty that necessarily accompanies any effort to think forward five, ten, or twenty years is required. For many people, some period of intense involvement in an important, large-scale project or enterprise has proved to be crucial. World War II was such an experience for a number of people and, indeed, there may be a generational factor at work: living in interesting times may contribute to being a good strategist. People who were involved—even if only in staff positions or on the peripheries—in some major decision-making body connected with that war had a special quality about them. Experiences in World War II clearly had a significant impact on a number of the people who were at RAND during the 1950s. Because they contained many people with World War II experience the Truman and Eisenhower administrations had a character to them that favored strategic thinking. This characteristic of administrations has gradually eroded since the late 1950s. The changes that we now see in the security environment of the United States will force another major effort of rethinking our situation, our goals, and our strategies. It might, therefore, be a period in which a generation of strategic thinkers will emerge as a result of the critical experiences they will go through in the next decade. Turning to the question of what kind of academic study or professional training might be useful, I would start with economics and business.

308 Andrew W. Marslial/ 同樣的方式。問題的一部分可能在於現有的分析方法大多是為了協助採購或運營規劃決策而開發的。當問題更像是：我應該從事什麼業務？我的競爭優勢在哪裡？來自商業世界或商學院的人可能有一個優勢，那就是他們習慣於解決這類問題，儘管通常使用的分析方法不太系統。什麼樣的背景和經驗有助於戰略思考？沒有特定的學科需要掌握才能成為戰略家。具有戰略思維的人來自多種不同的背景。在我所遇到並覺得我個人了解最好的人中，最好的學術背景似乎是經濟學、商學院、應用技術（特別是對於那些曾在商業世界工作過的人），以及在某些情況下的政治科學。但似乎核心是一種質疑的、兼收並蓄的思維方式，能夠設計出最廣泛的問題和目標，並能夠制定實現這些目標的適當方法。需要對伴隨任何向前思考五年、十年或二十年的努力所必需的不確定性有高度的容忍度。對於許多人來說，在一個重要的大型項目或企業中經歷一段時間的密集參與被證明是至關重要的。對許多人來說，二戰就是這樣的一次經歷，事實上，可能存在一個世代因素：生活在有趣的時代可能有助於成為一個好的戰略家。那些參與過——即使只是擔任職員職位或在邊緣——與那場戰爭相關的某個重大決策機構的人具有一種特殊的品質。二戰的經歷顯然對1950年代在RAND的許多人產生了重大影響。由於他們中有許多人擁有二戰經驗，杜魯門和艾森豪威爾政府具有一種有利於戰略思考的特徵。自1950年代後期以來，這種政府特徵逐漸消退。我們現在在美國安全環境中看到的變化將迫使我們再次努力重新思考我們的處境、目標和戰略。因此，這可能是一個時期，在這段關鍵經歷中，一代戰略思想家將會出現。至於什麼樣的學術研究或專業培訓可能有用，我會從經濟學和商業開始。

In the early 19 0 , when the first initiatives were taken within the Defen e Department to encourage appli ation of a set of ideas that later w re labeled a competitive strategi , I had a discussion with the chief of one of the military services. His reaction to the idea of designing some military programs so as to impose increased costs upon the Soviets was negative, or at least cautious. He had two arguments against focu ing on increasing Soviet costs or expenditures. The first was that the (')viets would simply pend the extra money, there were no reasons for them not to do so; the second was that our own budg ts fluctuate so much that it was unwi e to stimulate a competition which we ourselves might not sustain.

作為一種職業的策略309學校訓練，特別是商學院擁有強大的商業政策和策略課程。然而，我對經濟學的建議是謹慎的。自1940年代和1950年代以來，經濟學訓練變得過於數學化，過於專注於獲取一些在國家安全領域實際上用處不大的分析工具。研究生院的第一門課程可能就足夠了。然而，這些課程很重要，因為那些對宏觀經濟學和社會必須做出的基本權衡沒有概念的人，會發現很難清晰地思考將大比例的國內生產總值（GDP）投入軍事用途的長期影響。蘇聯的現狀在某種程度上是幾十年來沉重軍事負擔的結果，可能有25%到50%的GDP投入到軍事和外部帝國。在20世紀80年代初，國防部首次採取措施鼓勵應用一套後來被稱為競爭策略的思想時，我與一位軍事服務部門的首長進行了討論。他對設計一些軍事計劃以增加蘇聯成本的想法持否定或至少謹慎的態度。他反對增加蘇聯成本或支出的兩個理由是：第一，蘇聯會簡單地花費額外的錢，沒有理由不這樣做；第二，我們自己的預算波動太大，刺激一場我們自己可能無法維持的競爭是不明智的。這些論點中的第二個確實有其價值。第一個顯示出對蘇聯高水平軍事支出的長期後果或蘇聯可能被迫在個別計劃之間進行權衡的無知，因為資源總是有限的。經濟學訓練的另一個優點，或者說商學院訓練的優點，是獲得了一定程度的數學知識，並對技術的重要性有了一定的認識，能夠更有效地與技術專家和硬科學家互動。這是經濟學家在1950年代初期在RAND公司相對於政治科學家的優勢之一：定量分析是經濟學家習慣的，他們對技術專家正在做什麼的興趣或理解能力比政治科學家要好一些。人口統計學是另一個值得比過去在策略發展中更多關注的領域。人口統計學與政治和軍事行為的關係可能是一個日益重要和受到關注的領域。人口統計學經常被納入策略和廣泛國家政策的討論中。

JJO Andrew W Marshall but in only the most obvious and limited ways. William McNeill recently wrote a small volume adding some of the broader relationships of demography to political behavior. As in other of his works, he provides a number of hypotheses and sketches out areas that deserve considerably more attention. Additional fields of interest are cultural anthropology, ethology, and some areas of psychology. In some ways a new understanding of man is emerging, based on study of the evolution of man and human society and on new analyses of the biology of man, in particular the functioning of the brain. How men process information, make decisions, and behave are central issues on which much new knowledge exists and more will be available in the future. But above all, if I had a suggestion to make, it would be that people study, in any case at least read, history of all kinds: military history, of course, but also economic and technological history. The history or analysis of past wars is a major antidote to the narrow focus of many existing methods of analysis of defense issues. Most discussion of strategy and defense programs is, if anything, too focused on technology and weaponry and not enough on the other factors that often dominate actual warfare. Also, if one considers the extended competition between states such as Rome and Carthage, the issue of why the Romans won in the end may shed interesting light on the key variables that need to be considered in our conceptions of strategy. Another thing that is of great importance is to understand the differences in the ways in which other nations are likely to perceive situations and react to them. Specialized studies of the strategic culture of the Soviet Union, China, India, Japan, and the European nations are of great use. Some of this can be gained by reading the history of these nations, especially the development of their military and other national security organizations. Other aspects relate to the particular cultural characteristics of these societies.

The Future of Strategy

We are at a major turning point in the history of the world. A new structure is emerging, a more multipolar world with more complex alliance arrangements. Technology is likely to change the nature of warfare, much as it did in the period of the 1920s and 1930s. Then the development of naval aircraft and aircraft carriers revolutionized war at sea; on land the development of the tank and rugged, portable radios led to the invention of the panzer division and new concepts of operations that changed the nature of theater warfare; and, of course, there was the development of tactical and strategic air forces.

JJO Andrew W Marshall，但僅在最明顯和有限的方式中。William McNeill 最近寫了一本小冊子，增加了人口統計學與政治行為之間的一些更廣泛的關係。與他其他的作品一樣，他提供了一些假設並勾勒出值得更多關注的領域。其他感興趣的領域包括文化人類學、動物行為學和心理學的一些領域。在某些方面，一種對人類的新理解正在出現，這基於對人類和人類社會進化的研究以及對人類生物學的新分析，特別是大腦的功能。人類如何處理信息、做出決策和行為是核心問題，對此已有許多新知識，未來還會有更多可用知識。但最重要的是，如果我有一個建議，那就是人們應該學習，至少閱讀各種歷史：當然包括軍事歷史，但也包括經濟和技術歷史。過去戰爭的歷史或分析是對現有許多防禦問題分析方法狹隘焦點的一大解毒劑。大多數關於戰略和防禦計劃的討論，如果有的話，過於專注於技術和武器，而對那些經常主導實際戰爭的其他因素關注不夠。此外，如果考慮到羅馬和迦太基等國家之間的長期競爭，為什麼羅馬人最終獲勝的問題可能會對我們的戰略概念中需要考慮的關鍵變量提供有趣的見解。另一個非常重要的事情是了解其他國家可能如何感知情況並對其作出反應的差異。對蘇聯、中國、印度、日本和歐洲國家的戰略文化的專門研究非常有用。這些可以通過閱讀這些國家的歷史來獲得，特別是它們的軍事和其他國家安全組織的發展。其他方面則與這些社會的特定文化特徵有關。

戰略的未來

我們正處於世界歷史的一個重大轉折點。一種新的結構正在出現，一個更加多極化的世界，擁有更複雜的聯盟安排。技術可能會改變戰爭的性質，就像它在1920年代和1930年代所做的那樣。當時，海軍飛機和航空母艦的發展徹底改變了海上戰爭；在陸地上，坦克和堅固的便攜式無線電的發展導致了裝甲師的發明和改變劇場戰爭性質的新作戰概念；當然，還有戰術和戰略空軍的發展。
