16 Strategy as a Profession for Future Generations Andrew 11V. Marshall A Visit to Chartres and Jouy One of Albert Wohlstelter's distincJive characte,i.slics has alway been his search for the absol-ule best <f whatever is available. This has been true of everything: people, technical advice, furniture, medical care, and, pe1·lwps most impor/ant~v, food. In the mid-1950s, travel to Europe increased for many people at R/iND. In the faU of 19 56 my wife and 1 were in Paris at the same time as the Wohlsle/lers-Albl'rl, Roberta, mul Joani.f. Haruey DeWeerd was also there.. Early one Sunday mom.ing the six <f us wen/ eff to see 1hr: cathedral al Chames in a cnr Albert had rented. Albert had also noticed there was a one-star restauraril nearbJ, in the small I.own of Jouy. He telephon2d lo re.serve a. table. II was unumally cold for November and, of course, the church was unheated. His enthusiasm and fulelage were unbounded while we muttered quietly and froze. Nol a tympamm1, portal, wi.ndow, or earning went wmoled, inside or out. Finally WI' dro,Je off lo Jouy-ravenous and shivering. It was the first occasion for my wife and me to experience t.he wonderful French custom of a s-plendid SundaJ midday meal. Our expectations were high-muf. were reaiiud! A channing ruslfr inn, with gleaming coppn pans hanging in an open kitchen. The ebullient patron and his u)ije all smiles and welcomi-ng boo jours, a beaming presence in a room full of warmth and appetizing odors.

Strat gy al o focuses on longer-term goals and reflects a cast of mind that focuses on sh:aping the future rather than simply reacting to it. Our vocabul_ary and us of words in these areas are seldom precise or accurate. 1 he word straugy tends to be used in many way . Jo particular I woulcll note that in the national security area, which is the main focus of thi piece, there is a con tant tendency to think of military strategy as related principally to the application of resources in a possible future war and the general guidance for more detailed planning for pecific contingencies. The result is that there is relatively little discussion of strategies for the peacetime management of our militaTy organizations and for the allocation of resources over time so a to develop more efficient, effective, competitive military forces with appropriate doctrines and concepts of operations. Given the existence of nuclear weapons, the highest priority objective for the Unit d States has been deterrence of large-scale war. In this we have been largely successful. Therefore, the strategic management prob! min our natjonal security establishment has been the peacetime competition to preserve and indeed enhance io the future our ability to deter the Soviet Union from actions adverse to our intere ts. ow ven this definition of our priority objective may need serious amendment .u we move into a more truly multipolar world. . It is clear that some people eem more readily able to address issues of trategy or the strategic management of oor national security efforts.

But the cas of RA D is p rhaps of sp cial int rest because it did provide in th ,1950s and early 1960 a11 environment thait produced a number of people who are now a knowledged a.<. major SLracegic thinkers. The RAND E"perience There wa something special about the R 1D nvironmem from the late 1940s through most of the 1960s. for one thing, especially in the late 1940 and the 1950s, there was a sen of being on the leading edg , of dealing with the centrally important problems. The invention of nuclear weapons and se,•eral oth r technology developmencs at the end of World War II producecl a , ituation that was quite n w, one in which the issue of what our trateg should be was extremely important. Another aspect of this situation, given the large in rease in destructiv pawer nuclear weapons introduced, was that there were no experts. Two mall weapons had been used at the very end of World War II; what larger numbers of w apons migh do to change the nature of war was unclear. Nobel prize winners wer no better than graduate tudent in thinking about the relevant issues, and at meetings and working groups at RAND in the arly days there was no hierarchy. This was an ideal situation for younger people (the average age of the professional staff at RA O in 19!>0 was about twent -eight), who were immediat ly treated as equals and valued for what they could ontribute to the discussion . This is a rare situation, cenainly not characteristic of a ademia or normal organizations, and it led to the rapid development of individuals who wer willing to address the broadest issues of national security. There wa also a sense of having a preferred position with respect to access to infonnadon on the new de elopmenls taking place in weaponry, in particular in the design of nuclear weapons, their delivery systems, and other relevant technology. . Two _other (hings favor d the d velopment of strategic thinking and innovation at RA D. On was the freedom RAND had LO select the problems and the issue· on which it worked. This is very cliff; rent from the environment in contract tudies organizations, e pecially now. The other wa the pre nee of everal remarkable men who set the !ntellectual tone and style of mu h of the broader analysis that began in. t~e arly 1950s.

Apart from their wn intellectual contribution the· • · · · f fi -. s, 1r mtere t in the cult1vat1on o ull-rangmg discus ion their intelle t I r · . . . , c ua 1airness, and their interest _in the development of younger people and of new method of analys1 all favored innovation. One of the interesting things that happened at RA o wa~ the succes of the economists in assuming a leading role in the direction or a ~umb~r of important tudies an_d, more generally, in shaping the way m which RAND addr ed national !iecuriry issues. Initially the econo~is~s were brou~ht into what had been largely a technological organization to deal wtth what was called the military worth function. It had becom clear LO the technical p ople that they needed some assistanc in thinking about the oojectives that military weapon systems were to achie e. There wa also some interest in the conomics of defense, especially as it dealt with issue of mobiliz.:nion, and in the targeting of an opponent's industrial capacity and a ssing damage to indu.str ial socierie from strategic bombing. The economi ts soon played a much larger and more central role in managing and directing a numb r of the successful tudie . Why was this? Herman Kahn and I used to discuss chis puzzle. We had a number of hypotheses. For one thing the economics or the situation, broadlf conceived, were important. Whal things cost, the le,,el of resource that nations are able to devote to defen5e over an extended period-th se all shape one's views as to che kinds of weapon systems that are desirable and feasible. But another advantage the economists had was that they knew from their own experience that experts could be wrong. Indeed, they a.Isa knew that much discu5sion of economic ~roblems is foolish and that many widely held views, even among resp ns1ble people, are faulty. The experience or engineers and physicists i d!fferent. In those field there are real ex.perts who are much more hkely to be i-ight than are others. Economists. therefor , were more intellectually comfortable in the situation hat existed with respect to nuclear warfare, in which there were no exp res. One of the people in the economics department who was the fir5l to lead and manage a large RAND stud)' wa Al~ert WohlSletter. Beginning in the early 1950s, he examined a set of issues connected with the basing of long-range bombers.

The study 11 e ocuse . of the alternati e systems was the most cost-effective.

;06 Andrew lV. Marshall Alb rt's approach was different. He started with a few alternative to the existing plan or program, but as the study went on he evolved improved alternatives. He was also le~s ri_gjd than .had been the practice in sening down the criteria, the objective functions, the measures of effectivenes at the beginning of the stud and imply s icking with them. Hise olutionar appr ach developed additional criteria and tests of performance as more understanding of the pr blems and the issues emerged. This was, in my judgment, a crucial invention for doing these kinds of studies, becau e one would learn much more abou the nature of the issues and the problems. how one ought lo look at them, and what criteria were rel vant as one went further along in the studies. Also, this way of conducting the analysis had the advantage of inventing additional and better alternatives to examin as one went along. Another aspect of Lhe ituation al RA D that was exceptio11ally favorable to strategic thinking and inn vati n during the early period wa:; the practice of inviting first-rate people to come and spend the summer. This created an environment in which the important thing was to try to tap into the very best talent in the whole country. The objective was not to do the best that RA D could do with it.s exi ting staff, but in a sen to do an analysis that was the best that the cotmtry as a 1-.•hole could accomplish. By its very natur , any organization is limited in the amount and variety of talent, backgrounds, and insights that it can include among its staff. This attitude of searching for the very best people and drawing on the best talent is a key to excellence in broad thinking about any problem or issue. Unfortunately, most organization do not operate thi way. There is perhaps a natural history to most organizations. When they are first formed they are fo used on a. mission, they recruit people who are enthusiastic and who devote themselves to the goals of th organization. As time goes on the organization becomes less flexible, accumulates some deadwood, and has some difficulty in sustaining the original vitality. Organizations ometimes are formed in especially suitable environments that allow them to Houri h for a time. hen the external environment changes and the organization declin s in vitality. In any case, the RAND of the 1950s and early l960s as a remarkable place, both for the talent it recruited and for its atmospher and intellectual dynamic. It wa also remarkabl for its boldn in addressing broader que tion of strategy. It is, th refore, not surprising that some interesting and influential people dev loped there. The U.S. Government .

This. experience led me to believe th · while systems analysis ~ad been a liberating force during its ea~~ de_vel~pment, by the middle 1970s it had become a constraint on think mg strategically. People who were systems analyst.s found it difficu.lt to address the sorts of questions chat we felt needed t.o be considered in strategic planning. People with a business background or a com-bination of bus!ness school and mi!itary service seemed to be among the best at taking up and addressing the questions we wanted dealt with. We saw it as a vaccination problem: some backgrounds promoted strategic thinking and others seemed to innoculate people against it. Why is that? To some extent, the systems analysts had by that time developed routine approaches to analysis and perhaps had ceased paying sufficient attention to the complex consequences of acquiring the systems they dealt with. James Schlesinger made a comment to me a number of years ago that systems analysis proceeds by trivializing the mea-surement of effectiveness while perfecting the analysis and the estimate of costs. Programmatic actions, the acquisition of particular weapon systems, the adoption of a new concept of operations, or the setting of new objectives for military forces have complex consequences, including their effects upon the beliefs, actions, and resource allocation patterns of the potential opponents. Most of these consequences are not usually considered in the standard kinds. of analysis. One result is that the top leadership of the Department of Defense ofte~ gets remarkably little assistance from their staffs when truly strategic de-cisions are addressed. This is because the focus of the work of the staffs, the criteria they use, and their measures of effectiveness_ ~re too narrow to account for the considerations that top-level dec1s1on makers in fact want to consider, are concerned with, and take imo account as best they can. Some decisions have larger and different consequences than others. For example, a decision to pursue or create a major strategic _defense capability is different from a decision among several alternat~,•e pro-grams for the next generation of fighter aircraft.

308 Andrew W. Marslial/ the same way. Part of the problem may be that much if not all of the existing analysis methodology was developed to assist in procurement or operational-planning decisions. Other m thod of analysis are nec-essary when the questions are more like: What busine·. es should I b in? Where are my competitive advantages? On advantage people from the business world or busines schools may have is 1hac they are used to addressing thes kinds of que1>tions, though often with analysi method that are le s systematic. What Backgrounds and Experiences Are Conducive to Strategic Thinking? There is no specific set of disciplines that mus£ b mastered to be a strategi t. Peopl who think strategically come from a number of different backgrounds. Among tho whom I have met and feel that 1 know personally the best academic backgrounds seem to be onomics, bu ine s chool, applied technology (especially for those who have been in the bu iness world), and in som ase political cience. But what se ms to b central is a ca t of mind that is questioning, eclectic, able LO devise the broadest kind of issues and goals, and able to formulal appropriate ways of achieving these goal . A high tolerance for tll uncertainty that necessarily accompanies any effort co think forward fnre, ten, or twenty years is required. For many people, some period of intense in ·olvement in an imponant, large-scale project or merprise has proved to be crucial. World War JI was such an experience for a number of people and, indeed, there may be a gen rational factor at work: living in interesting limes may contribute to being a good trategist. People wtio were involved-even if only in staff positions or on the peripheries-in ome maj r decision-making body connected with that war had a special quality about them. Experi nces in World War II cleuly had a ignificanl impact on a number of the people who were at RAND during the 1950s. B cause they cont ined m.any people with World War II ex-perience the Truman and Eisenh wer administrations had a character to them that favored strategic thinking. Thi characteristic of admin-istrations has gradually eroded ·ince the I.ate 1950s. The changes that we now se in the ecurity environment of the United States will force another major effort of rethinking our situa ion, our goaL, and our strategies. lt might, th refore, be a period in which a g nera~ion of strategic Lhinkers will emerge as a result of the-cnt1cal experiences they will go through in the next de ade. !~rning_to the question of what kind of academic study or professional trammg might be useful, I would start with economics and business

Strattgy as o Profession 309 school training, pecially busine s school that have st . . rong programs in business policy and strategy. My recommendation abo . . ut economics is, however, a guarded on . Since the 1940s and 1950 • . . s, economics training has become too mathematical too focus d on the . · · · . . · • acqu1m1on of par11cular a_nalyttc tools that are not, in fact, or mu h use in the national security area. S mething like the fir t course in graduate school ma be enough. They are important, how ver, because people who do not have a sense of macroeconomics and the fundamemal trad -offs that soci ti_es h_ave _ to make find it difficult to think clearly about the long-term 1mpl_1cauons of devoting large, possibly exce sive, percentages of gros nauonal pr ducts (G Ps) to mihtar use . The current stat of the Soviet nion i in some part the result of decades of a heavy military burden with perhaps on the order of 25 to 50 percent of G P devoted to the military and the external empire. In the early 19 0 , when the first initiatives were taken within the Defen e Department to encourage appli ation of a set of ideas that later w re labeled a competitive strategi , I had a discussion with the chief of one of the military services. His reaction to the idea of designing some military programs so as to impose increased costs upon the Soviets was negative, or at least cautious. He had two arguments against focu ing on increasing Soviet costs or expenditures. The first was that the (')viets would simply pend the extra money, there were no reasons for them not to do so; the second was that our own budg ts fluctuate so much that it was unwi e to stimulate a competition which we ourselves might not sustain. The econd of these arguments has real m rit to it. The firs! shows an unawareness of the long-term consequences for the Soviet of high levels of militaq' expenditures or of possible trade-offs between individual program the Sovieu; might be compelled to make, since resources always are limited, . Another virtue of economics training, or for that matter busm s-school training, is that a modest amount of mathematics is ac~~ired, as is some sense of the importance of te hnology and _an ~bihty t? interact more effectively with technologist and hard s~1~m1st~. T_his was one of the advantages the economi ts had over _the palmcal sc_ienll ts at RA D in the early 1950 : quantitative analysis ~v~s som~thmg the economi ts were used to and lheir interest in or ability to di cuss and understand what the technologists were up to was omewhat better than that of the political sci ntists. . . h d ch more attention Demography 1s another area t at e.serv mu h than it has had in the past in the development of 5°'.1t gy. . le I . . 1-• l d mi'Jitary behavior 1s hke Y re auonsh1p of demography to po lllCa an . ph , (0 be an area of increased importance and attention.

JJO Andrew W Marshall but in only the most obvious and limited ways. William McNeill r cently wrote a small volume adde ing some of the broader relationships of demography to political behavior.2 As in other of his works, he provides a number of hypotheses and ketche out areas that de erve considerably more attention. Additional fields of intere t are cultural anthropology, ethology, and some areas of psychology. In some ways a new und rstanding of man is emerging, based on tudy of the evolution of man and human society and on new analy es of the biology of man, in particular th fonctioning ofth brain. How men proces information, make decisions, and behav are central issue on which much new knowledge exists and more will be available in the future. But above all, if I had a suggotion to make, il would be that peopl study, in any case at least read, hisrory of all kinds: military history, of course, but also economic and technological history. The history or analysis of past wars is a major antidote to the narrow focus of man existing m thod of analysis o( d fense issues. Most discussion of strategy and defen e programs is, if anything, too focu ed on technology and weaponry and not enough on the other factors that ofren dominate actual •.-.-arfare. Also, if on considers the xtended competition between states such as Rome and Carthage, the issue of why the Romttn won in the end may shed interesting light on the key variables that need to be considered in our conceptions of strategy. Anoth r thing that i_§ of great importance is to understand the differences in the ways in which other nations are likely to perceive situations and react to them. pecialized studi . of the strategic culture of the Soviet Union, China, India, Japan, and the European nations are of great us . Some of this can be gained by reading the history of these nations, especially the development of their military and other national se<:urit organizations. Other aspects relate co the particular cultural characteristics of these societies. The Future of trategy We are at a major turning point in the hi tory of the world. A new structure is emerging, a more multipolar world with more complex alliance arrangements. Technology is likely to change the nature of warfare, much as it did in the period of the 1920s and 1930s. Then the development of naval aircraft and aircraft carriers revolutionized war at sea; on land the development of the tank and rugged, portable radios led to the invention of the panzer division and new concepts of operations that changed the nature of theater warfare; and, of course, there was the development of tactical and strate1Zic air forces.

What our strategy should be for the more complex competition that is emerging will require consideration of many aspects of the changing security environment and changing technology. We will need to know much more than we now do about the emerging regional powers, as well as about the likely major actors, their strategic orientation, their strengths, and their weaknesses. It is to be hoped that new centers of strategic thought and innovation will arise and a new generation of strategists and military innovators will develop to deal with these problems. Notes ).
